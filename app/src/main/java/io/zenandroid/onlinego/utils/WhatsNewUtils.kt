## What's new

- Shiny new app icon.
- I rewrote the settings screen so that it looks cleaner and helps people find the desired settings easier.
- Added the ability to become a project supporter by doing a monthly donation though Google Play. There are no supporter-only features, this is meant as a donation for the project. 
- Fixed a bug that prevented old low-memory devices from using google login
- Changed a few of the icons to make them more consistent. Yes, I did have to learn how to create vector icons using Figma...
- Pressing back after navigating to several games now takes you back directly to the home screen (thanks to sdeframond for the contribution)
